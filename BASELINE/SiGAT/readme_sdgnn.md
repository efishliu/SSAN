#  SDGNN: Learning Node Representation for Signed Directed Networks

## Abstract

In this paper, we propose a novel Signed Directed Graph Neural Networks model named SDGNN to learn node embeddings for signed directed networks. The proposed model simultaneously reconstructs link signs, link directions, and signed directed triangles.

## Overview
This [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10958) is accepted at AAAI2021.

> We provide a Pytorch implementation of SDGNN model.
> You can change different aggregator and other parameters to explore different architectures.
